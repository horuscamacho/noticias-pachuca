Publer is an established all-in-one social media management solution (over 12 years in the industry, with 520k+ users) that lets you schedule and publish posts, collaborate with team members, and analyze performance from a single web platform.","Until recently, Publer did not offer a public API, focusing on its web and mobile apps. In mid-2025, Publer introduced an API (initially in beta) now available for Business and Enterprise plan users, signaling a new focus on automation and developer use cases. Still, Publer\'s core positioning remains a full-featured social media toolkit for non-technical users, with the API as a powerful but add-on component."]},"late":{"title":"Late\'s Positioning","paragraphs":["Late, by contrast, is the new kid on the block – an API-first upstart built from the ground up for developers and automation. Late\'s philosophy is essentially \'API as the product.\' It provides a unified social media scheduling API that lets you programmatically post to multiple networks via a single integration, with an optional lightweight web UI for convenience.","Late was designed to appeal to developers, SaaS companies, and agencies who want to embed social posting capabilities into their own apps or workflows without dealing with dozens of platform-specific APIs. While Late does have a simple dashboard for manual use, its primary positioning is a \'social media scheduling API for developers\' (in fact, it\'s often pitched as a Publer or Buffer API alternative)."]},"summary":"In short: Late is the lean, code-friendly solution, whereas Publer is the feature-packed scheduling suite – each appealing to a different audience and use case."}},"platforms":{"title":"Supported Platforms and Core Features","intro":"When it comes to supported social networks, both Late and Publer cover the major bases – but Publer casts a wider net whereas Late focuses on the most common platforms:","cards":{"late":{"title":"Late: 10 Major Platforms","paragraphs":["Supports Twitter (X), Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, Facebook, YouTube, Threads, Reddit, Pinterest, and Bluesky via a unified API. These are the big-name social networks most developers need for posting.","Late\'s philosophy is to handle the intricacies of these APIs under the hood, giving devs one consistent way to publish content everywhere. All supported platforms are available on every plan (even free).","Late\'s feature set is intentionally streamlined: it focuses on content publishing (single posts or batch scheduling) and basic media handling. It does not attempt to replicate a full social media management suite – for example, Late has no built-in content editor, social inbox, or detailed analytics dashboard."]},"publer":{"title":"Publer: 13 Platforms + Rich Features","paragraphs":["Supports everything Late does plus Google Business Profiles, WordPress (for blog posts), Telegram, and Mastodon. Notably, Publer does not list Reddit in its supported networks – a platform Late does handle.","Along with support for standard post types, Publer\'s platform breadth allows for special content: Facebook Reels and Stories, TikTok videos, multi-photo carousels, LinkedIn PDFs, polls, and more.","Publer offers a rich set of tools beyond just posting: a visual content calendar for planning, an AI Assistant for generating copy, hashtag suggestions, automatic RSS feed posting, post recycling and recurring schedules, first-comment scheduling, and in-depth analytics reports."]},"summary":"Summary: Late covers fewer platforms (10 vs Publer\'s 13) and sticks to core scheduling/posting, whereas Publer supports a wider array and layers on many extras. If your social media strategy involves publishing to WordPress blogs or Google My Business updates (which Late doesn\'t do), Publer has the advantage. But if your focus is the main social networks and you prefer a simpler toolkit, Late\'s pared-down approach may be sufficient."}},"api":{"title":"API Availability, Design, and Developer Experience","intro":"A key differentiator between Late and Publer is how they approach their APIs and developer-friendliness:","sections":{"publer":{"title":"Publer API: Feature-Rich but Gated","paragraphs":["Historically, Publer did not have an open API for developers – it was a closed system used via its own UI. This changed in 2025: Publer launched a RESTful API after a beta period, but notably it\'s only available to Business and Enterprise users (and approved ambassadors). In other words, accessing Publer\'s API requires a paid high-tier plan; it\'s not accessible on the free or lower-tier plans.","Assuming you do have access, Publer\'s API is quite comprehensive in scope: it exposes not just post scheduling endpoints, but also analytics data, media library management, workspaces/accounts management, and more. Essentially, Publer is exposing much of its internal platform functionality via API.","The Publer API uses standard REST with JSON and requires an API token (with user\'s workspace context) for authentication. One limitation to note is rate limiting: Publer\'s API is rate-limited to 100 requests per 2 minutes per user (roughly 50 requests/min).","For non-developers, Publer suggests using automation tools like Zapier, Make, or n8n to connect to the API without coding. In fact, Publer has indicated plans to build native integrations for Zapier/Make/n8n after the API launch."]},"late":{"title":"Late API: Developer-First Design","paragraphs":["Late takes a radically different approach – the API is the core offering, and it\'s available on every plan, including free. You can literally sign up for Late\'s free tier and obtain an API key within minutes, which lowers the barrier to entry for developers experimenting or building prototypes.","Late\'s API is a unified REST API that abstracts away the differences between platforms. For example, instead of juggling different payload formats or authentication flows for each social network, Late provides a consistent JSON format and handles the platform-specific nuances behind the scenes.","You can specify your content and a list of target platforms (or simply \\"platforms\\": [\\"all\\"] to broadcast to every connected account) in one API call – Late will then fan-out and post to each network\'s API for you. This \'one payload to rule them all\' design is a huge convenience; as the Late team likes to say, one API call can replace seven separate integrations in your codebase.","The developer experience is clearly a priority: Late provides clean documentation with examples, SDKs in multiple languages, native webhook support, and generous throughput for high-volume use. In terms of rate limits, Late mentions ~600 requests/minute on standard plans and up to 1200/min on higher tiers – an order of magnitude higher than Publer\'s limit."]},"summary":"The key takeaway: Late\'s API is designed by developers for developers – if you value a straightforward, well-documented API with high limits and the ability to plug into your CI or codebase, Late shines. By contrast, Publer\'s API is powerful in terms of features, but it feels like an extension of a larger product – it\'s tied to certain plans and may not be as open or immediately accessible for hacking around."}},"scheduling":{"title":"Scheduling Logic, Reliability, and Automation Friendliness","publer":{"title":"Publer\'s Smart Scheduling","paragraphs":["Publer provides a rich toolkit for scheduling flexibility.

Late\'s explicit uptime guarantee and its focus on being infrastructure-heavy (enterprise-grade) might appeal if you require guaranteed performance. Publer, having a larger feature surface, might occasionally face more UI-level bugs, but it\'s battle-tested by a broad user base. If your primary concern is ensuring posts go out on time every time, Late\'s singular focus on that problem is reassuring."},"pricing":{"title":"Pricing Tiers and Scalability","intro":"When comparing Late and Publer, pricing and scalability can be a make-or-break factor – especially for agencies or businesses managing many social accounts. The two products have very different pricing models:","cards":{"publer":{"title":"Publer\'s Per-Account Model","items":["Free: 3 accounts (no X, no API)","Professional: ~$12/mo for 3 accounts","Business: ~$21/mo base + $7 per extra account","Team members: +$3 each on Business"]},"late":{"title":"Late\'s Flat Tier Model","items":["Free: 2 profiles, 10 posts/mo (API included)","Build: $19/mo - 10 profiles, 120 posts","Accelerate: $49/mo - 50 profiles, unlimited","Unlimited team members on all plans"]},"example":{"title":"Cost Example: 50 Profiles","items":["Late: $49/month","Publer: ~$320-350/month","Savings: ~$270+/month with Late"]}},"summary":"Summary: For small-scale usage, both platforms can be low-cost. But as soon as you need the API or more profiles, Late\'s pricing becomes far more economical. An agency with 25 accounts would pay $49/month on Late, compared to perhaps ~$150+ on Publer. If you\'re a developer integrating this into your product for many end-users, Late\'s fixed plans make cost planning easier."},"collaboration":{"title":"Team Collaboration and User Experience","cards":{"publer":{"title":"Publer – Built for UI Teamwork","paragraphs":["Publer offers a robust set of collaboration features ideal for marketing teams and agencies working through the Publer interface. It supports multiple workspaces (so an agency can have separate client workspaces), role-based permissions, content approval workflows, and a collaborative calendar.","The Business plan allows adding team members (at $3 each extra) and client approval workflows.

The assumption is that if you need complex collaboration, you might handle that outside (e.g., using project management tools or your own app)."],"summary":"Best for: Teams that want basic collaboration support but prefer to build their own user experience around the API."},"verdict":"UX Summary: If you put a social media manager with no coding experience in front of both tools, Publer\'s interface will feel more immediately at home – everything they need is right there. Late\'s interface is straightforward but limited – that user might use it only to connect accounts and then prefer to schedule posts via another tool.

Now that the Publer API is live, you can integrate with automation platforms by utilizing their API endpoints in HTTP modules. Publer has publicly stated plans to build direct integrations soon."}},"verdict":"Integration Summary: Both Late and Publer can connect with Zapier, Make, and n8n – Late has a bit of a head start with an official n8n integration and a proactive approach to no-code support, whereas Publer is catching up, using its new API to facilitate these connections.

The entry-level paid plan, Professional/Standard, starts around $99 per month (billed annually) for a single user and up to 5 social accounts.","If you want to pay monthly or need up to 10 social accounts, it jumps to roughly $149/month. That plan gives you the basics (scheduling, a content calendar, basic reports), but many features are restricted. Need more than one user? You\'ll have to upgrade to the Team/Advanced plan at $249/month (annual) which allows 3 users and ~20 accounts.","Now, Late\'s pricing is refreshingly down-to-earth. It offers a forever-free tier (10 posts a month, 2 profiles) for starters. Paid plans then scale in a straightforward way without per-seat fees. For $19/month you get 120 posts and 10 profiles (Build), and for $49/month you get unlimited posts and 50 profiles (Accelerate). For businesses needing more, the Unlimited plan at $999/month provides unlimited profiles and unlimited posts."],"highlightTitle":"Cost Comparison Example:","highlight":"An agency with 50 social accounts and a handful of team members: With Late, that agency could be on the Accelerate plan at $49/month.

The Hootsuite API allows programmatic scheduling of posts, fetching of social data, etc., but it has historically been oriented toward partners and enterprise clients.","Many developers have found Hootsuite\'s API to be a bit of a relic: it\'s based on an older architecture and, as reports have noted, it hasn\'t seen major updates in years. In fact, Hootsuite\'s API was missing support for some of the newer social networks and features even while the main app had them. For example, long after TikTok became a must-have platform, Hootsuite\'s API still didn\'t provide endpoints for TikTok scheduling because the API hadn\'t caught up."],"highlight":"Reality Check: Hootsuite\'s developer experience feels like an afterthought – understandable, since their core business is selling the all-in-one tool, and most customers use the dashboard, not the API."},"late":{"title":"Late: API is the Product","paragraphs":["Now, Late flips this script entirely. The API is the core product, but it\'s not API-only. Everything you can do through Late\'s simple web interface is also accessible via clean REST endpoints with straightforward JSON payloads. The company clearly targets developers – there\'s an entire onboarding flow and docs site just for integrating the API – but also provides a clean UI for non-developers or when you need to quickly post something manually.","Because Late was built recently, it uses the latest best practices (JSON only, sensible endpoints, good error messages). And crucially, it stays up to date with platform changes. For instance, when Threads (the new Twitter-like platform by Meta) came out, Late added support for Threads posting quite fast, ensuring its API could handle that alongside Twitter, Facebook, etc."],"highlight":"Developer Quote: \\"Setup took 15 minutes.

Hashtags can be temporarily or permanently banned based on current events, policy changes, or community guideline violations."},{"question":"What happens if I use a banned hashtag?","answer":"Using banned hashtags can result in your post being hidden from hashtag feeds, reduced reach, or in severe cases, temporary account restrictions. It\'s best to avoid them entirely to maintain healthy account performance."},{"question":"How accurate is this hashtag checker?","answer":"Our checker is based on known banned and restricted hashtags, but Instagram\'s list changes frequently. We recommend using this as a guide and always monitoring your post performance to identify any issues."},{"question":"Can I check hashtags in multiple languages?","answer":"Currently, our tool focuses primarily on English hashtags. However, banned hashtag policies apply globally, so many restricted terms translate across languages. We recommend checking hashtags in your target language as well."},{"question":"What is an Instagram shadowban and how do I avoid it?","answer":"A shadowban occurs when Instagram limits your content\'s visibility without notifying you. Using banned hashtags, posting inappropriate content, or engaging in spam-like behavior can trigger shadowbans. Avoid banned hashtags, post authentic content, and engage naturally to prevent shadowbans."},{"question":"How many hashtags should I use per Instagram post?","answer":"Instagram allows up to 30 hashtags per post, but we recommend using 3-10 highly relevant hashtags. Quality over quantity is key - choose hashtags that accurately describe your content and target audience rather than maxing out the limit."},{"question":"What\'s the difference between banned and restricted hashtags?","answer":"Banned hashtags are completely blocked and won\'t show any posts when searched. Restricted hashtags may show limited content or have reduced reach. Both can harm your visibility, but restricted hashtags might still be usable in moderation with careful monitoring."},{"question":"How do I know if my account is shadowbanned?","answer":"Signs of a shadowban include: sudden drop in engagement, posts not appearing in hashtag feeds, reduced reach to non-followers, and decreased story views. You can test by asking friends to search for your posts using hashtags you\'ve used - if they can\'t find them, you might be shadowbanned."},{"question":"Can using the same hashtags repeatedly get me shadowbanned?","answer":"Yes, using identical hashtag sets repeatedly can trigger Instagram\'s spam detection. Vary your hashtags for each post, create different hashtag groups for different content types, and avoid copy-pasting the same hashtag combinations every time."},{"question":"How long does it take to recover from a shadowban?","answer":"Shadowban recovery typically takes 1-2 weeks of clean posting behavior. During this time, avoid banned hashtags, don\'t use automation tools, post high-quality content, and engage authentically. Some accounts recover faster, while others may take longer depending on the severity."}]},"related":{"title":"Related Tools","items":[{"title":"Instagram Handle Checker","description":"Check if your desired Instagram username is available.
